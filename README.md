# PresentationsRota
The "Presentation Rota" project is a simple Python script that assists in randomly selecting individuals responsible for presentations or reflections in a team or group setting. In this script, we utilize random selection and statistics to ensure the participation of all group members in presentations while maintaining balance.

The script employs a list of participants defined in the students variable. It then randomly picks an individual responsible for a presentation for each of the 20 weeks and displays this information. After going through all the weeks, the script determines who presented most frequently and displays that information.

This tool can be useful for teams looking to maintain balance among participants in presentations or reflections and ensure equal opportunities for all members.

The script is straightforward and easy to use, with configuration limited to defining participants in the students list. You can now use this tool to plan and manage presentations in your group.

If needed, you can customize and expand this script to meet the specific needs of your group or project.
